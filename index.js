 * 1. Create an async function "initialLoad" that does the following:
 * - Retrieve a list of breeds from the cat API using fetch().
 * - Create new <options> for each of these breeds, and append them to breedSelect.
 *  - Each option should have a value attribute equal to the id of the breed.
 *  - Each option should display text equal to the name of the breed.
 * This function should execute immediately.

/**
 * 2. Create an event handler for breedSelect that does the following:
 * - Retrieve information on the selected breed from the cat API using fetch().
 *  - Make sure your request is receiving multiple array items!
 *  - Check the API documentation if you're only getting a single object.
 * - For each object in the response array, create a new element for the carousel.
 *  - Append each of these new elements to the carousel.
 * - Use the other data you have been given to create an informational section within the infoDump element.
 *  - Be creative with how you create DOM elements and HTML.
 *  - Feel free to edit index.html and styles.css to suit your needs, but be careful!
 *  - Remember that functionality comes first, but user experience and design are important.
 * - Each new selection should clear, re-populate, and restart the Carousel.
 * - Add a call to this function to the end of your initialLoad function above to create the initial carousel.

/**
 * 4. Change all of your fetch() functions to axios!
 * - axios has already been imported for you within index.js.
 * - If you've done everything correctly up to this point, this should be simple.
 * - If it is not simple, take a moment to re-evaluate your original code.
 * - Hint: Axios has the ability to set default headers. Use this to your advantage
 *   by setting a default header with your API key so that you do not have to
 *   send it manually with all of your requests! You can also set a default base URL!
 */
/**
 * 5. Add axios interceptors to log the time between request and response to the console.
 * - Hint: you already have access to code that does this!
 * - Add a console.log statement to indicate when requests begin.

 * 6. Next, we'll create a progress bar to indicate the request is in progress.
 * - The progressBar element has already been created for you.
 *  - You need only to modify its "width" style property to align with the request progress.
 * - In your request interceptor, set the width of the progressBar element to 0%.
 *  - This is to reset the progress with each request.
 * - Research the axios onDownloadProgress config option.
 * - Create a function "updateProgress" that receives a ProgressEvent object.
 *  - Pass this function to the axios onDownloadProgress config option in your event handler.
 * - console.log your ProgressEvent object within updateProgess, and familiarize yourself with its structure.
 *  - Update the progress of the request using the properties you are given.
 * - Note that we are not downloading a lot of data, so onDownloadProgress will likely only fire
 *   once or twice per request to this API. This is still a concept worth familiarizing yourself
 *   with for future projects.

 * - In your request interceptor, set the body element's cursor style to "progress."

 * - This function is used within Carousel.js to add the event listener as items are created.
 *  - This is why we use the export keyword for this function.
 * - Post to the cat API's favourites endpoint with the given ID.
 * - The API documentation gives examples of this functionality using fetch(); use Axios!
 * - Add additional logic to this function such that if the image is already favourited,
 *   you delete that favourite using the API, giving this function "toggle" functionality.
 * - You can call this function by clicking on the heart at the top right of any image.

 *  - You will have to bind this event listener to getFavouritesBtn yourself.
 *  - Hint: you already have all of the logic built for building a carousel.

 *    repeat yourself in this section.

/**
 * 10. Test your site, thoroughly!
 * - What happens when you try to load the Malayan breed?
 *  - If this is working, good job! If not, look for the reason why and fix it!
 * - Test other breeds as well. Not every breed has the same data available, so
 *   your code should account for this.
